Explore the fascinating journey of data management and storage technologies in the field of computer science! "Time Travel Through Data Evolution" compresses decades of key events into a single day, showcasing the evolution of databases and storage systems from magnetic tape to modern NoSQL databases.

## Overview

- Visualize major milestones in an evolution on a compressed timeline.
- Understand the time gaps between each breakthrough.
- Gain insights into the pace of advancements.

## How It Works

This project utilizes Python and data visualization libraries to:
- Create a compressed timeline of events based on input years and event names.
- Calculate and display the time differences between events.
- Visualize the timeline as an interactive line chart.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages using: `pip install matplotlib numpy`

## Usage

1. Update the `input_events` dictionary in `main.py` with your own data.
2. Run `main.py` to see the compressed timeline and time differences.
